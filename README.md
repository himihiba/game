# 🎮 Game Development Learning Project  

This repository is part of my ongoing learning process in **Canvas and Game Development principles**.  
I am following a tutorial from **[de Franks laboratory]** and documenting my progress.

## 🎮 Project Overview  

This project focuses on building fundamental game mechanics using **JavaScript and the Canvas API**.  
So far, I have completed two major steps:  

### **1️⃣ Sprite Control & Animation**  
🔹 **[Demo: Sprite Animation](https://himihiba.github.io/game/spriteAnimation.html)**  
✅ Implemented sprite sheet animation.  
✅ Controlled character movement with frame updates.  

### **2️⃣ Layer Control & Animation**  
🔹 **[Demo: Parallax Background](https://himihiba.github.io/game/parallaxBackground.html)**  
✅ Added multiple background layers for a parallax effect.  
✅ Controlled the speed and movement of layers.

## 🚀 Future Goals  

🔹 Learn and implement **collision detection, physics, and AI behavior**.  
🔹 Implement **user controls and interactions**.  
🔹 Develop a **small playable demo** based on these mechanics.  

This is a **work in progress**, and I will update the repository as I learn more!
